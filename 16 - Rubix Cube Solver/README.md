- **Piece Validation:** Instantly checks for physically impossible configurations (like duplicate edges or invalid corners) before solving.
- **Kociemba Solver:** Runs the solver algorithm inside a Web Worker so the browser never freezes.
- **3D Animation:** View the step-by-step solution on a 3D cube with speed controls.
